Basically, they’re moral cowards and their weakness to even hold a meeting in the face of Linux’s demise tells you the real reason why Linux is doomed:  Its creators and foundations do not believe in the community or Linux.  Remember, these are the same people who \"attend\" these conferences using MacBooks (including the Director of the Linux Foundation!).  They’re sheep. Worse, they're sheep who don't sufficiently even like, use, or believe in Linux, except as an aesthetic appeal.  Think whatever you like of my words, but don't take my word for it. Go to the LF's website and look at who they openly brag about having as its sponsors.\n\nI’ll hate seeing Linux go or even fade.  I’ve been using Linux distros for over 15 years, but I can mark the moment I started cheering for its demise—when Linus caved in to the Twitter mob commissars and PC’d the kernel to keep his job (like some kidnap victim, after being subjected to mandatory ‘sensitivity training’ by his poofing handlers).  All the while, the creators of the kernel spend almost 100% of their web space bragging about being receptacles for corporations who ‘donate’ to their corrupted and compromised foundations.  I’ll never use Fuchsia, but in a way I actually look forward to the Linux Foundation going under (or getting consumed).  I guess I will need to start looking at BSD or Haiku.","comment_id":"b2725ab00f8b360c43823acffe8d948e5e8ae9a81185b44c53aaf0c5c16dea55","claim_id":"166742a68faca1abdf189ae4134de2d527576969","timestamp":1613785423,"signature":"2c7cc0482c94bf7f443e3b85218f20907effd8b40b52e0a8eb56912a20df1362e5589d989c9308182230046f53ab561c9c317e4faf7dcc8208f1a6868fe1d1e9","signing_ts":"1613785422","is_hidden":false,"is_pinned":false,"channel_id":"5d184b3e084d520e9bb0a6b807cc9ae59564bad0","channel_name":"@ReformT","channel_url":"lbry://@ReformT#5d184b3e084d520e9bb0a6b807cc9ae59564bad0","replies":2},{"comment":"No, it doesn't.

Linux on the Pi is full of proprietary blobs since the Pi foundation doesn't really care about FOSS and choose hardware that depends on non-free software to run properly. They also pretend that their desktop is made in house when it is just LXDE by calling it the Pixel desktop. There are many distros that are leaner than Debian for ARMv7 + LXDE (= Raspberry Pi OS). I think most users like a kernel that supports new hardware over a kernel that doesn't. Most of the code in the kernel isn't used on most hardware, but it is nice to have those FOSS drivers built-in.

I would not like to have to use Gnome just because it is the default desktop in Fedora. The resources people spend on doing their own thing is not resources that would have gone towards a unified project. The freedom of choice we have between corporatebacked distros, community based ones, free software only ones, free software by default, but non-free available, long term stability, fast rolling, slow rolling etc are good things that no non-FOSS OS can replicate. It is a bit confusing for new users, but it is also very liberating once you understand that most knowledge you learn on one distro is transferrable to another and you get to choose what fits the use-case best instead of having a one-size-fits-all like Windows or Mac OS. Developers can develop a linux binary that can run on any distro (as long as dependencies are installed) by making it for their distro of choice. If the software is any good, the community will package it up for other distros. Or they can make a flatpak, snap or AppImage if they are less inclined to trust the community to package it for them or want to give people other options. Linux is whatever you want it to be, and that is one of its core strengths. The user is in charge.","comment_id":"7296cc8ba3fe8bde5e586ad6ae088e39a894e48635c104c2e2f02e566213362c","claim_id":"166742a68faca1abdf189ae4134de2d527576969","timestamp":1613780166,"parent_id":"8437bb70e8e60d9e8d935e2571a731e50a0dcae123741a3583f788ec8e9e70e3","signature":"8fd56df0ae57d0b23b178e5673757764e54187fae3f5546a8577bf729bfe250ff82cc2e09d225ac3eb799fd4c79f39857f55135d059649f4df700b5a50415147","signing_ts":"1613780166","is_hidden":false,"is_pinned":false,"channel_id":"6079a3e7c06ba9cdf7433e6a2c514942fc661c39","channel_name":"@einar","channel_url":"lbry://@einar#6079a3e7c06ba9cdf7433e6a2c514942fc661c39"},{"comment":"The LInux-libre kernel is that free software only version.

I really do.  I've been using the OS long enough, but in the case of the kernel, this was not a mere instance of toning anything down.  It was a re-write of the kernel's coding language.  And it was not done for any utilitarian reason.  It was done as a form of tone-policing and imposing its language control on us.  For example, banning terms like whitelist, master, slave, blacklist, etc.  None of these words have any association with discrimination/made-up-ism.  They know that and even admit it (just look up Intel's Dan Williams who oversaw this crime back in July).  \n\nTo put this another way, imagine me getting control of all history books for public schools in the U.S. and banning any mentions of civil rights, MLK, and (make it even more fun) 'social justice.'   That is the equivalent of what was done here and it was done for a reason.  As in the case of Linus signing off on the assault on language in the Linux kernel, this is a way for the foundation to send a message to us.  Controlling language is always about controlling people. This act was not some small thing.  It was a declaration of war against every person who believes in the overriding principle of free software, freedom.  And it's not just the Linux Foundation (which at this point is a paid front organization for Silicon Valley monopolies).  Look at the business practices of Canonical \u0026 what they have done to Ubuntu.  It has become more and more like MacOS in its attempts to control the user experience, on top of it selling itself to data-miners \u0026 for-profit spyware cloud services.

They will just move more and more into AWS or the Azure Cloud or whatever, and there it really doesn't matter *what* they run and let's be real: They don't care either. They just need a platform to run their Dockerses and Kuberneteses on, and if they work on Toaster OS 3.7, that's what they will use.\n\nThe tiny percentage of people using their favourite FoTM Linux distribution on their desktop or laptop system or pinephone or whatever for personal use certainly won't switch to Fuchsia either. But let's be real - we don't matter. Never have.\n\nBut think about it: Android is Linux. And if google wills it, Android will go away. It's not like Android has much use beyond providing a basis for running google services, really, so if google were to pull out (and they will pull out eventually), Android will not have a purpose anymore. \n\nSo yeah - most people by a long shot who use linux today will switch to Google Fuchsia, once Google decides to flip the switch. \n\nAnd at first glance, I'm tempted to say I could not care less - Android will not be missed. But as usual, it's not that easy. This isn't the Linux 2.4 days anymore. The Kernel is a giant monstrosity that's pretty much out of control. And so is the whole ecosystem around it. Your garden variety small/medium enterprise running a webserver on top of a hypervisor on Debian will not be able to maintain or develop the Linux Kernel any further and neither will your favourite enthusiastic basement dweller. Were it not for big corporations like Google and recently Microsoft that drive development of those monstrosities for their own purposes (like Android and Azure or whatever) we wouldn't get anywhere with them anymore.

But they have to recognize that Linux too is past critical mass for maintainability, so they're in a holding pattern to see which way the industry turns.\n\nIt's not a bad plan actually.","comment_id":"b9666aa79de7eb0df632940d590aa90f96d6d2d417854450c96eb1e494b5dafa","claim_id":"166742a68faca1abdf189ae4134de2d527576969","timestamp":1613570996,"parent_id":"a19ceb6534f7a105b908fbae95249c5e7f135f77c300f9f30bfbf1309ef21d60","signature":"93cfa9d07ce7a017dbf483493c8e5d32dd64a91bb6ed82c13c7c38d017a17f4af7d49d6cad396a6f1600f0690f2c619702f28223302b87cd39d3a5c1a872325a","signing_ts":"1613570996","is_hidden":false,"is_pinned":false,"channel_id":"80f3081884e79fc5ce9deef74734e407c733f297","channel_name":"@iKarith","channel_url":"lbry://@iKarith#80f3081884e79fc5ce9deef74734e407c733f297"},{"comment":"Plan 9 is \"new\"?","comment_id":"61a61b11d377e3506bc09138bd5ab6e2978b2763a7f005339e04fee7affc7694","claim_id":"166742a68faca1abdf189ae4134de2d527576969","timestamp":1613570760,"parent_id":"51b4ee632835ad153c36fa5d820f2fdec431ed36325576b422a2f352a9e5f634","signature":"482a7b3d839c9d2ec1b973d53f2adfa50ae47ab69e1704c6361788352a1b68fa3bb50ca1b5321a9cae9f1e5a30d9706a3a132119e0dca5092f0d48adc6fa3cf0","signing_ts":"1613570760","is_hidden":false,"is_pinned":false,"channel_id":"80f3081884e79fc5ce9deef74734e407c733f297","channel_name":"@iKarith","channel_url":"lbry://@iKarith#80f3081884e79fc5ce9deef74734e407c733f297","replies":1},{"comment":"@voidmuppet Yes and no. The hostility tends to keep to keep the larger BSD userbase somewhat fractured among the at-least-three forms of BSD. Are Debian, Red Hat, and Arch users really all that fractured? They are—but not in a way that matters for corporate interest in it.\n\nThe other thing BSD doesn't have is momentum. Notice how a few years ago (realizing its been more than a few now) every company wanted to \"start doing Agile\". Failing to understand that Agile is something that you ARE, not something that you \"DO\". But it seemed like such a great idea, and it was the new hotness. So everybody jumped on the bandwagon and now there's this bloated process called \"Agile\" which isn't, perverting the process some people came up with to … be agile!\n\nIf BSD suddenly gained that steam (and it's really hard to do it after it's been lost, and BSDs steam was lost back in the 80s sadly), all these idiots trying to add all the things to Linux would be adding it to BSD. There'd be a bunch of forks since they could keep their proprietary stuff proprietary, and it'd all peter out.\n\nIn this way it's too bad the focus became \"Linux\" and not the \"GNU\". (No I'm not gonna start saying GNU-slash-Linux or GNU-plus-Linux\" or whatever politically correct silliness the FSF wants to promote. If it _had_ been called GNU, though, people would've realized a lot sooner than now that the Linux kernel is just one more component of the OS that can be replaced. You can NeoVIMify Linux! And it would be good for Linux if people did so.","comment_id":"e854cb13284596bbcf0dfacbfa4bada6e0523d8fd25cbb134fd1ff57d519c7f2","claim_id":"166742a68faca1abdf189ae4134de2d527576969","timestamp":1613570714,"parent_id":"4148a8aadf7d262c1750f9a646792fac2c61822fdb5b1d1fd78a526298c6b458","signature":"d9a3b02fe2e4221b930b2119a142b7bce00f83704884badb413c044f665e8a61df3d782ff6d237c50ca2396735ce1a9e3c9f7f88111eb424643fb9cdd1a4cf06","signing_ts":"1613570714","is_hidden":false,"is_pinned":false,"channel_id":"80f3081884e79fc5ce9deef74734e407c733f297","channel_name":"@iKarith","channel_url":"lbry://@iKarith#80f3081884e79fc5ce9deef74734e407c733f297"},{"comment":"I agree, the Linux Foundation dudes should buy hardware by f.e.

The forked trees can maintain some level of architecture inter-compatibility for that kind of hackery to function, but it would vacuum out much of the problems that a monolithic source tree is beleaguered with.\n\nOr the Linux source can take a page from the AOSP source tree philosophy and not have the kernel under one single project - at all. Filesystems, architectures, charsets, devices - these can be split into separate projects or groups of separate projects. This model can allow the 5.25\" FDD driver suffer when it's not usually pulled into the tree for the makefile - so if something else in the kernel breaks it, it won't be a concern until someone wants a kernel *with* the 5.25\" FDD support.","comment_id":"67b8146298c84974ccb203b00069ed7318e473495b0a6d203daba73e2713e20a","claim_id":"166742a68faca1abdf189ae4134de2d527576969","timestamp":1613489115,"signature":"5db5ddf0cc0e30224aa7649426a9098b218fb21188a9c1ee627107bfeabda203894a66ab68bc84d9694f797b0df092e355f714c621c3431b9296d58f3da8662f","signing_ts":"1613489114","is_hidden":false,"is_pinned":false,"channel_id":"69b541216dc70633c132cc49a8288ef854fb2094","channel_name":"@jaymax","channel_url":"lbry://@jaymax#69b541216dc70633c132cc49a8288ef854fb2094"},{"comment":"thank you for taking the time, your responses have been very helpful","comment_id":"41ef317f7c9c901a24fbbfcc679f93c1f98358ad5891605df032b0ef6162f818","claim_id":"166742a68faca1abdf189ae4134de2d527576969","timestamp":1613488219,"parent_id":"cd0870499a9572f136a2f34ab0df7924fa53c59bbc0bce538333450e2f55e600","signature":"4fc55a64f8f496b867f4c2f302e8de4e388b4564ef52dc80c6a4d0fd78aea8a921f77ef92300b03727724856182ec8f6c56b15c844de5279f487a5220bd3b914","signing_ts":"1613488219","is_hidden":false,"is_pinned":false,"channel_id":"4d135370a5043160692d5a1dd4a78c01eae581f7","channel_name":"@vasitzin","channel_url":"lbry://@vasitzin#4d135370a5043160692d5a1dd4a78c01eae581f7"},{"comment":"Well, damn.

And Canonical has done more to Embrance and Extend parts of the Linux desktop than almost anybody! Microsoft could not E\u0026E Linux more if they literally ported Windows 10 to run as a container! (And I've been saying since 2018 that they're more than considering the possibility!) What's holding them back (if anything) is probably Fuchsia and the potential move away from the amd64 architecture whose useful life is not at an end yet!)\n\nCanonical has largely failed in its attempts in part because its different-to-be-different ideas ended up being dumb, and the transparency of their motives had been pretty obvious. But imagine if the kernel itself were a playground they could E\u0026E and keep some features for themselves. In 2006, I'd have said nah, wouldn't happen. In 2021, wouldn't they?\n\nRichard Stallman was right. The GPL has protected Linux as it was intended to do. It hasn't forced others to his vision where all software is free software, but Linus never intended it to and that's fine with him and with me.

A FreeBSD guy I knew once explained the then current state of things: \"OpenBSD wants to keep everything small and manageable, and will target anyone who either tries to change that or who annoys Theo. NetBSD changes runs literally everywhere, but modern systems are impacted by bugs in decades-old hardware nobody uses anymore. It targets people who try to change anything. FreeBSD wants to be cool and modern about everything except what defines 'proper UNIX'. It targets anyone who gets in the way of changing things, even unintentionally.\" He may have used different exact words, but I think I'm communicating his thoughts accurately.\n\nAnother friend from days gone by told me about a time he didn't understand and asked on a mailing list if someone could explain the differences between the BSDs. Theo put him in his killfile for this. He knows this because about every six months or so afterward (and it'd been MANY years at the time), he'd get an email from Theo at that address informing him that he was indeed still killfiled and nothing he ever sent to Theo (or apparently any list Theo is on) will be seen. I worked on a project for awhile with a guy who thought that highly of himself and equivalently lowly of everyone else. I don't anymore.\n\nFreeBSD is most interesting and has the Linux application layer already. But applications aren't what I care about bringing over from Linux. The drivers—I want the drivers! I don't care how much of a shim you have to put between a Linux driver and a new kernel. For any type of driver for which a shim exists, it should be possible for someone who is not a kernel developer to take an out-of-tree Linux driver, drop it into this framework, and compile a working driver. Turning an in-tree driver into an out-of-tree driver might be the hard part there. We'd certainly want binary application support to be maintained, but the driver might be semi-permanent for some devices.","comment_id":"4148a8aadf7d262c1750f9a646792fac2c61822fdb5b1d1fd78a526298c6b458","claim_id":"166742a68faca1abdf189ae4134de2d527576969","timestamp":1613485783,"parent_id":"8c0a034efaff505cfa5ce1f6599043157246ee21d93772e921b43e939828683d","signature":"e05cc74760cdc7a90bebb36f053da19c643999ab142be3defd79add0dcf227b2872b31d9b024e3229dcd2bfd6dfdfa68cf72d2574adaa25015084e1b88991f1f","signing_ts":"1613485783","is_hidden":false,"is_pinned":false,"channel_id":"80f3081884e79fc5ce9deef74734e407c733f297","channel_name":"@iKarith","channel_url":"lbry://@iKarith#80f3081884e79fc5ce9deef74734e407c733f297","replies":2},{"comment":"Linux is on a Morphine drip...","comment_id":"3997317d7e9e6e0c5c872be8128f5b0a59b9f13766184ca8d001f7cbc143a246","claim_id":"166742a68faca1abdf189ae4134de2d527576969","timestamp":1613484314,"signature":"cea67b9b0fdc2a4d7a047e79c77b6df893547ea0fbdcf8774984b950181b61758a42503cf52be8728afe3b1d78bd05d2c2fcfdc29824bb4979cf56ad26a48076","signing_ts":"1613484314","is_hidden":false,"is_pinned":false,"channel_id":"511ee872310d622865dd065023284d04f00bd714","channel_name":"@chubbywood","channel_url":"lbry://@chubbywood#511ee872310d622865dd065023284d04f00bd714"},{"comment":"Political dissidents concerned with opsec will create a demand for an OS that's not too painful of an off-ramp from Windows or MacOS.

The expansion of the Linux kernel over the last few years has been adding HUGE capabilities - different hardware platforms, all kinds of devices, all kinds of filesystems, all kinds of virtualization, and all kinds of security features and tools.\n2) ALL of the dead OSes you mention were owned by corporations, and were either killed by those corporations or abandoned. Linux doesn't have that problem, which is why it has outlasted them all. Fuschia faces the same problem - it's a Google project, not a community project. Will it be used on their products? Probably. Will that migrate into the server space that Linux dominates? Hardly. And when Google moves on, it'll be abandoned.\n3) Linux is still, by far, the best alternative available. It's also the only alternative that *can* be forked and taken in a new direction. The only way it will be replaced is if something better comes along, and there's nothing on the horizon in that regard.","comment_id":"528e42b59c509658a8dc748c160edfb8a6716f792856fb59b1043b4ca333cafa","claim_id":"166742a68faca1abdf189ae4134de2d527576969","timestamp":1613471186,"signature":"0e1132f0ed3e9538de85749a38d2acd891e107424b281fbc043e2be329c0bf18fb97da41f4a99db6ab8d65905742376640af7126fb84a84f2d49305d1e8345f2","signing_ts":"1613471186","is_hidden":false,"is_pinned":false,"channel_id":"1533e7140dcb966ebcdf22ff4c5a13f75615d1a8","channel_name":"@Aetius","channel_url":"lbry://@Aetius#1533e7140dcb966ebcdf22ff4c5a13f75615d1a8","replies":1},{"comment":"You're pronouncing fuschia wrong.

Consider what I said above: Microsoft considers Windows 10 to be in maintenance mode. It's full of half-finished transitions to newer technologies that don't always work, etc. There's three separate technologies for encrypting a drive on Windows, for example: One is Windows-tier-locked, one only works on certain hardware, and one is third-party. ALL are incompatible with each other, and at least one of the ones Microsoft wrote themselves is only half-written, doesn't integrate with the rest of the OS, etc. It was a side project to replace NTFS that died on the vine, but MS shipped it because it was better than nothing.\n\nQuite probably, Linux's replacement—if written by Linux users/developers—will begin as a drop-in replacement for Linux on a very simple (and virtual) system. When it's ready, it should drop right in. Maybe e.g. systemd (if we're still using that) will gain the ability to recognize the new kernels' capabilities and use those, and maybe after currently Linux distributions transition to it, the old Linux features will not be compiled in anymore, and possibly even be dropped by a fork looking to refactor and simplify code.\n\nWin9x gave way to NT, and both coexisted for awhile. When the transition came, depending on the user's level of experience, they'd have scarcely noticed except for the Luna window dressing and the fact that they now suddenly had to login.\n\nIt'll be the same with Linux.","comment_id":"c2b4aeffc252058d4a6b1cfc96517e838dd97921af4b8a823874d19f6dc00166","claim_id":"166742a68faca1abdf189ae4134de2d527576969","timestamp":1613467506,"parent_id":"76a6b1e83563c52dfc835305a872f7794fac8081c82684f31ee5afce3fc5e209","signature":"fc1cb26f4c3f51bffb39e8945925a219cda1fa25869f1155d54d4b1cc37f894b3fd4b39bc17a9820364a3d6400892134e369570105b74287e681bc5bb9205917","signing_ts":"1613467506","is_hidden":false,"is_pinned":false,"channel_id":"80f3081884e79fc5ce9deef74734e407c733f297","channel_name":"@iKarith","channel_url":"lbry://@iKarith#80f3081884e79fc5ce9deef74734e407c733f297"},{"comment":"@9:50 Tivoli, Software Artistry, Lotus, Lexmark, Arsenal, Informix, Rational, Candle, the list is endless...","comment_id":"2bc65186dbe3f04f0483612a47dea28c2f0d06cdae98312a53661930c2ff66fd","claim_id":"166742a68faca1abdf189ae4134de2d527576969","timestamp":1613467426,"signature":"eb41b5a77c74b7cb4dc868a64b0465536f42ef882f612ed33c5390f264bd3a5731ac543f560f058d29a31828a8d7f7b1a629777777148c494727e10411d58e39","signing_ts":"1613467426","is_hidden":false,"is_pinned":false,"channel_id":"e8614d97648dff580d18fca164a6fff513f0dc29","channel_name":"@TheCaveWall","channel_url":"lbry://@TheCaveWall#e8614d97648dff580d18fca164a6fff513f0dc29","replies":1},{"comment":"@3:55 qualifications are boring.

It's not even multi-user except experimentally via feature creep. Minix exists, sure. BSD … well, we'd lose the Linux drivers and there's a lot of those.\n\nThe reason I think we might want something new is because we would want several of those modern security features available without a lot of the legacy crud you have to maintain on Linux. It still runs on a 486!\n\nhttps://hackaday.com/2020/07/08/the-latest-linux-on-a-floppy-in-a-486/ \n\nDon't get me wrong, I love me some vintage computing! And I've got many machines that were obsolete when Linux on a 486 was state of the art. But I don't expect my Apple II to run Linux. And I don't expect my Pentium MMX to run the same 5.8.x kernel I run on a Zen 2 chip either.\n\nI think a new kernel would probably best begin with a look at its external interface and function, and then design what gets you that interface and function. Classic top-down approach, but beginning with today's assumptions of what the finished product needs to be built for—threads, privilege separation, sandboxing, IPC, etc. Knowing how that's all supposed to work beforehand makes it easier to write as efficiently as practical.\n\nThe driver model … Linux has adapted fairly well to the change in hardware landscape. It predates PnP devices, hotplugging, IPv6, and so much more. But you still can't unload a driver for a device you've removed from the system to reclaim its memory space.\n\nActually, some third party vendors have found ways to even replace the kernel you're running with a new one without rebooting, but it's not in Linux. Could it be? I don't know—does it end up being an enterprise-only feature and home parlor trick, or can the design of the kernel facilitate passing messages of the kernel's state to a new kernel and pivoting over to it, unloading the old? I dunno yet.","comment_id":"69dfaf5b1d0d1f96b4f3385eb3510f4c116606b62815c2b862c49abdd8735884","claim_id":"166742a68faca1abdf189ae4134de2d527576969","timestamp":1613465758,"parent_id":"910dda52e708977743a2cdfa30957df6fa78a20d114fb0f8f11389894d490d32","signature":"048d322506e22de5917e9dacda407889d6e095161af710c263e67e582fc7bb9c0faaec9c83f1aab02bcf1fa863db31fe83a951de4ffc10cf727f2a1e729faa31","signing_ts":"1613465757","is_hidden":false,"is_pinned":false,"channel_id":"80f3081884e79fc5ce9deef74734e407c733f297","channel_name":"@iKarith","channel_url":"lbry://@iKarith#80f3081884e79fc5ce9deef74734e407c733f297"},{"comment":"so amiga os shall rise like a phoenix?","comment_id":"50e9ed62fce95ea8903a8d72ec8185e9776baa62028b89b196a42eadc9b8aa92","claim_id":"166742a68faca1abdf189ae4134de2d527576969","timestamp":1613465583,"signature":"c7cec315b0135a684783cab7a54b91b06ca6d171d1de94e0f11845c6fbc815cc09afe9bf92db86efb999af850b237dcacf6aeb04cd3c560ec49761ba998909fb","signing_ts":"1613465581","is_hidden":false,"is_pinned":false,"channel_id":"934655622942a96e60c4d65ff735a911aeca7483","channel_name":"@BitsnPCs","channel_url":"lbry://@BitsnPCs#934655622942a96e60c4d65ff735a911aeca7483","replies":2},{"comment":"Ooh, yes, let's have a Linux conference/superspreader event!

I like the majority of Lunduke's content, but the one thing that truly sucks, is listening to these tiresome Linux sucks videos every single year. I don't even know why I do it. The whole Prophet of Doom thing is rather annoying and he's taking a bunch of completely unrelated dots, and scribbling lines in between, to try to connect them. And what rules? I know it seems longer, but the personal computer has only even been around for the last 40 years. Which really isn't that long. So the *statistics* are being made right now, with every new day forward. And while I agree that the complexity of the Linux kernel would do well to slow down a bit, all of those features and all of that complexity, isn't so easy to replace by any one company, even a company with Google's resources. But Fuschia, setting aside the ridiculous name, is not even released or developed yet, let alone proven and capable of replacing Linux on a single machine. So I'd probably hold off giving your eulogy just yet. Google's motivation has nothing to do with betting against Linux either. They hate the GPL for some irrational reason, and they want total control over everything. But before betting everything on Google's horse, and assuming it's going to be so good, that it's capable of taking over the world, consider also that Google already has any anti-Trust case being built against them, and that's without monopolizing the entire Linux market. Which means, Fuschia may very well be doomed before it's even gotten out of the gate, and almost certainly would be if it completely killed off Linux and managed to take over everything like a cancer. Google itself may very well be in trouble eventually, without Fuschia. ONLY time will tell about that, just as with Linux.","comment_id":"933745070de12cf2c15fb611b7ad9c7a03a65c4f9b18ac0e8455713789a197d0","claim_id":"166742a68faca1abdf189ae4134de2d527576969","timestamp":1613462135,"signature":"4b5b69243ed1157a2f6ea9e59ddecea8ce27aea4793f28ac8b8afa90cccbc597a31fd30c2cf473b3da863c626dc4ca2092ef3e23ae096ff3f77060a2bd8b2485","signing_ts":"1613462135","is_hidden":false,"is_pinned":false,"channel_id":"e8bd1f3cdf8dc8edd05f412fe11c81ea7da2dd94","channel_name":"@drakkar123","channel_url":"lbry://@drakkar123#e8bd1f3cdf8dc8edd05f412fe11c81ea7da2dd94","replies":2},{"comment":"Pretty sure the people who demand no-hug conduct codes will send people with badges after any such group or gathering with demands for arrests.\n\nI wish I was being hyperbolic, but we've seen it.","comment_id":"68f83251f363c044feed73452bbe6e09ff21a9d0958c136dd626da1dd8d73827","claim_id":"166742a68faca1abdf189ae4134de2d527576969","timestamp":1613462090,"parent_id":"9fcf3323e90075aa969cceb454d4dd4627c801e9db632c45c049c7458074509f","signature":"a8eb1461c632d57cf89e851c49d22438e92fccdb321955113ebc669f27d499dc8840bb0ba8cb75baa1e365aa81071b951266724d3a9c56a948dc455de69f986d","signing_ts":"1613462089","is_hidden":false,"is_pinned":false,"channel_id":"80f3081884e79fc5ce9deef74734e407c733f297","channel_name":"@iKarith","channel_url":"lbry://@iKarith#80f3081884e79fc5ce9deef74734e407c733f297"},{"comment":"I will give up and go off grid if I have to use an OS from Google.","comment_id":"987072fe91d58d217b7afb275e03618716e3b168cb14cb0a3b9cdb981f19cffa","claim_id":"166742a68faca1abdf189ae4134de2d527576969","timestamp":1613461724,"signature":"706f3f93906bcb94fdbe8a7cae4292c9768dce69ab339b30a0132962fe0a3f1ec02336b76c8a9734d73fa7375831acde55cadd36286b3cf0862264862bf6d576","signing_ts":"1613461724","is_hidden":false,"is_pinned":false,"channel_id":"45ba740364f73af3ddd3ebae34623c35fc3da18f","channel_name":"@MikeInAL","channel_url":"lbry://@MikeInAL#45ba740364f73af3ddd3ebae34623c35fc3da18f"},{"comment":"Well that was fucking depressing.","comment_id":"447748e513ea90fbe05f51bdebfafb6793da14060a286a64d581a1d00f9be684","claim_id":"166742a68faca1abdf189ae4134de2d527576969","timestamp":1613461177,"signature":"6c664798f724d1843fa202e5cfd4eea65bad934163aed875e2d54ba92b5698f82c9fc5c2f41e7bfac51fac13b1aba0a022faf03f58792038cb5f69eb350a338a","signing_ts":"1613461177","is_hidden":false,"is_pinned":false,"channel_id":"194423d8f2be5ced22bb54b55ec65ea1ee4da513","channel_name":"@MightyMurderMittens","channel_url":"lbry://@MightyMurderMittens#194423d8f2be5ced22bb54b55ec65ea1ee4da513"},{"comment":"35:18\nWow!

Betting an interface layer to recycle Linux drivers would be pretty high on the development priority list. It could work out. Will it? I don't know.","comment_id":"25063d2a2fb2ae5f6d9ca2cc289bb2bc049b54b2f3bbbcd1e05fde20bd49929a","claim_id":"166742a68faca1abdf189ae4134de2d527576969","timestamp":1613442829,"signature":"33c52fc66935898995b479ff1312abf27c040ae75cdadc9d8912fa3668db7f10e4945228b083aac1e39e88f23bcd9f980707a3cb7833051834f8deecc796ef9e","signing_ts":"1613442829","is_hidden":false,"is_pinned":false,"channel_id":"80f3081884e79fc5ce9deef74734e407c733f297","channel_name":"@iKarith","channel_url":"lbry://@iKarith#80f3081884e79fc5ce9deef74734e407c733f297","replies":5},{"comment":"The fear and paranoia of the C-virus has caused everyone to stop thinking for themselves and stop gathering in groups.

Or somesuch. x86 is a nightmare, anything that has to keep up with intel's increasingly insane control freak CPUs is going to be a nightmare, and anything used broadly by enterprise clients is necessarily going to be a nightmare. Linux was doomed when it became the default OS for enterprise servers. The future of personal computing, as in \"_computer_ that _computes_ things you _personally_ want to do in the presence of your _person_\", as opposed to \"dumb terminal that sells your personal data as rent for computing on the 'cloud' (i.e. someone else's computer)' ...
